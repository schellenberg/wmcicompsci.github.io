# Overview of CS20 Textbook (so far)

[bit.ly/csopentext](http://bit.ly/csopentext)


## Scratch

- lots of work to be done (was still learning the Runestone toolset while teaching this part of the course)
- each lesson has a video tutorial (so that I can go back and write up the appropriate text)

## Reeborg

- nearly complete
- some updates will be made in Feb (as I don't want to change anything until this cohort of students have completed the course)
- it's been a good experience to contribute to the development of this software as part of creating the textbook
- useful demos
	- [step 3](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/ConstrainedLanguage/Step3.html) (world is the same every time)
	- [step 16](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/ConstrainedLanguage/Step16.html) (word changes, and student solutions need to work in all situations)
	- [second practice quiz](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/ConstrainedLanguage/PracticeQuiz.html)

## Python

Still work to be done (particularly with nailing down the pacing, and fixing up the Micro:bit sections). However, looking at the following will give a good sense of some of the parts of the Python section that are particularly nice.

- [Getting Started - 8. The while statement](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/Python/Overview/WhileLoopsIntro.html)
	- executing code within the textbook, codelens to step through code
- [Getting Started - 9. Our First Turtle Program](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/Python/Overview/FirstTurtleProgram.html)
	- Parson problems (mixed up code)
- [Functions in Detail - 2. Writing Fruitful Functions Practice](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/Python/Functions/WritingFruitfulFunctionsPractice.html)
	- automatic checking of functions and instant feedback
- [Image Processing - 1. Image Processing and Nested Loops](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/Python/MoreAboutIteration/NestedLoops.html)
	- Negative image example
- [Strings - 4. Turtle Drawing and Strings (L-Systems)](https://sk-opentexts.github.io/computerscience20/Python/Strings/LSystems.html)
	- drawing fractals
