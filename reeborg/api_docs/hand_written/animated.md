Worlds can be more visually interesting by adding animated tiles. To create an animation, a series of different images is associated with a given object. All tiles are animated (i.e. the image shown changes) at a set interval (the default is 120 ms), which is independent of the animation time use to show each excution step of the program; this time can be ajusted.

Currently, 5 different types of animations are supported.

1. All animated images of a given type cycle through at the same time. This is shown on the bottom row (`y=2`) in the animated image below where I have chosen to represent all animated tiles in by the same images (numbers from 1 to 5). The animation time has been slowed down from the default.
2. Each animated tile cycle through an orderly fashion, but starts at a random point in a cycle. This is shown on the second bottom row (`y=4`) below. Note that two of the tiles shown here happen to cycle in synchronicity with those of the bottom row.
3. Each animated tile changes randomly at each cycle. This is shown on the `y=6` row.
4. A single cycle through all the images is done; after it is completed, the last image is shown repeatedly. (Currently, it is redrawn each time, even when it is not changing). This is shown on the `y=8` row.
5. A single cycle is done after which the tile/object is removed from the world. This is only possible for tiles/objects which cannot be picked up by the robot (where more than one object of a given type can be at a given location).
