<h1>Guido van Robot Exam</h1>

<p><em>Please note that you must answer each of the following questions SEPARATELY.</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Define a new function called goToOrigin that positions a robot on 1st Street 
    and 1st Avenue facing east, regardless of its initial location or the direction 
    it is initially facing. Assume that there are no wall sections present. Hint: 
    Use the south and west boundary walls as guides.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Program a robot to run a super-duper steeplechase. In this race, the hurdles 
    are arbitrarily high and arbitrarily wide. In each race course the finish 
    is marked by a beeper, which the robot must pick up before turning itself 
    off. For full marks, your robot must be able to run the steeple chase on the
    following worlds: <a href="steeple.wld">world 1</a>, <a href="steeple2.wld">world 2</a>,
    <a href="steeple3.wld">world 3</a>. <br />
    <img src="steeple.JPG" width="512" height="384"><br />
  </li>
  <li>Write a definition for a new function, pickAndFace, whose action depends 
    on how many beepers there are on the corner where a Robot named Guido is standing. 
    Guido may be facing in any direction when this instruction is invoked, and 
    there may be anywhere from 0 to 5 beepers on the corner: <br>
    <br>
    No beepers on corner: Guido does nothing. <br>
    1 beeper on corner: Guido picks it up and faces north. <br>
    2 beepers on corner: Guido picks them up and faces west. <br>
    3 beepers on corner: Guido picks them up and faces south. <br>
    4 beepers on corner: Guido picks them up and faces east. <br>
    5 beepers on corner: Guido picks them up and turns himself off. <br>
    <br>
    Thoroughly test your program out on a variety of worlds.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
